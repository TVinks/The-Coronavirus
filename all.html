            <h2 id="what">What Is A Coronavirus?</h2>
            <p>A coronavirus is a family of viruses which cause respiratory infections. There are multiple
                coronaviruses, mainly including the common cold, MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), SARS (Severe
                Acute Respiratory Syndrome), and recently, COVID-19 (The Coronavirus, or Coronavirus 2019).
                <br> <br>
                COVID-19 is the recently discovered coronavirus which is also known as SARS-CoV-2. This virus was unknown until the outbreak in Wuhan,
                China in December 2019. </p>

                <h2 id="avoid">How To Avoid COVID-19?</h2>
                <p> <u>If you want to both reduce spread of COVID-19 and make sure you don’t get the virus you should:
                    </u> <br> <br>
                    Clean your hands on a regular basis with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitiser/hand rub.
                    <br> <br>
                    Maintain at least a 1 metre distance between yourself and anyone else. Also don’t go on any form of public
                    transportation, ride sharing or taxis. <br> <br>
                    Always avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. If you happen to be carrying COVID-19 on your
                    hands, if you were to touch your face it gives the virus a chance to enter into your body. <br> <br>
                    Cough and sneeze into your elbow (and wash that area as soon as possible) or preferably a tissue
                    which you can dispose of. This helps to reduce the spread of the virus so that individuals with a
                    bad or suppressed immune system don’t catch the virus. <br> <br>
                    If you feel unwell or align with the symptoms, stay home. This will make sure that you can’t spread
                    any illnesses to others. <br> <br>
                    Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 information and hotspots (cities or local areas where
                    COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to these places – especially if you are
                    an older person, have diabetes, heart or lung disease or just a bad immune system. If you do live in
                    one of these areas, try to stay home or away from areas with large amounts of people. </p>

            <h2 id="symptoms" >What Are The Symptoms Of COVID-19? </h2>
            <p><u>The symptoms of COVID-19 can often be difficult to differentiate between The Flu or The Common Cold.
                    This means that if you get these symptoms you should contact your local GP or doctor:</u><br><br>
                A Fever<br>
                Coughing (similar to the flu)<br>
                Sore Throat<br>
                Fatigue<br>
                Shortness Of Breath<br><br>
                <u>In More Severe Cases You Can See:</u><br>
                Pneumonia<br>
                Kidney Failure<br>
            </p>
            <img class="contentimg" src="breath.jpg" alt="Shortness Of Breath"

            <h2 id="spread">How Does COVID-19 Spread?</h2>
            <p>This disease spreads from person to person and others with the virus. Droplets and fluids from the nose
                or mouth contain the virus and are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets
                land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch the virus by touching these
                objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they
                breathe in these droplets from a person with COVID-19. This is the main reason for why people should
                stay 1.5 metres away from one another so that droplets can’t spread to others.</p>
