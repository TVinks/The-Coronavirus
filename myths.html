              </div>
            <h3 id="elderly">Only The Elderly Can Get The Coronavirus</h3>
            <p> This is not true. Coronavirus can infect anyone, whether it be someone completely healthy or someone who
                is not nearly as healthy.
                <br> <br>
                Although this is the case, elderly people and people who have health conditions such as diabetes or
                asthma have a much higher chance of becoming severely ill.</p>
            <img class="contentimg" src="M1.jpg" alt="Coronavirus" style="width:50%">
            <div>
                <h3 id="flu">Coronavirus Is Just Like The Flu</h3>
                <p> No this is not the case. Although they have very similar symptoms such as aches, fever, and coughs,
                    coronavirus is estimated to have a higher fatality rate in terms of percentages. Although the
                    coronavirus is more deadly, the flu still can kill not as healthy indiciduals, both having the
                    possibility to cause pneumonia.</p>
                <img class="contentimg" src="M2.webp" alt="Coronavirus" style="width:70%">
            </div>
            <h3 id="mask">Facemasks Prevent Coronavirus</h3>
            <p>No, unfortunately this is not entirely true, although, you should definately wear a wask if possible if your
                local area has COVID or if your local government recommend it. Healthcare workers use professional grade face masks, which
                fit tightly around the face, to protect them against infection. However, disposable face masks are
                unlikely to provide such protection and can end up not being able to help at all. As these masks don't
                fit close enough to prevent anything from getting in, droplets containing covid-19 are able to easily go
                through the mask and into your system. Even some tiny particles are able to go straight through the mask
                as well. <br> <br>
                However, if someone has does have the virus (or any other respiratory virus), wearing a mask can help
                protect others from becoming infected. It is important for everyone to wear a mask in infected areas
                so that individuals who have COVID and do not know it are unnable to spread the dissease. This means 
                that if you do have it you should definately wear a mask to prevent the spread of the virus.
            </p>
            <img class="contentimg" src="M3.webp" alt="Mask" style="width: 70%;">
            <h3 id="bio">Antibiotics Kill Coronavirus</h3>
            <p>No, this is not true. Antibiotics are only able to kill bacteria and won't do anything to fight the
                virus.</p>
            <img src="M4.jpg" alt="Antibiotics" style="width: 70%;">
            <h3 id="parcel">Parcels, Letters And Packages Can Carry Coronavirus</h3>
            <p>No, this does not happen. As coronavirus isn't very good at staying alive on surfaces for longer periods
                of time, it means that even if a package had coronavirus, it would most likely die by the time it reched
                your location.</p>
            <img src="M5.jpg" alt="Parcel" style="width: 70%;">
            <h3 id="sauna">Coronavirus Will Die If You Go Into A Sauna Or A Hot Environment</h3>
            <p>No, temperatures in a saunas or hot environments won't be hot enough to kill the virus. You would most
                likely have heat stroke before you kill the virus within your body.</p>
            <img src="M6.jpg" alt="Sauna" style="width: 50%;">
            <h3 id="bat">Coronavirus Came From Eating Bats</h3>
            <p>This is most likely not the case. It is believed that the virus was spread from bats to humans through a
                marketplace. It is also believed that the virus spread from the bat to another animal which gave it to
                humans. This intermediary has not been found yet but researchers believe that it could have been a
                snake, a turtle or a pangolin.</p>
            <img src="M7.webp" alt="Bat" style="width: 60%;">
            <h3 id="lab">The Virus Originated In A Lab In China</h3>
            <p>This is definately not the case. Although a large amount of individuals online believe that the virus
                began in a lab in Wuhan there is no evidence which supports this theory. In fact, a recent study
                demonstrates that the virus is a natural product of evolution. This virus was believed to start from a
                snake, a turtle or a pangolin in a marketplace in Wuhan.</p>
            <img src="M8.webp" alt="Lab" style="width: 50%;">
            <h3 id="bite">Coronavirus Can Be Transmitted Through Insect Bites</h3>
            <p>No it cannot. There is no evidance which suggests that it can be transmitted through a bite from an
                insect.</p>
            <img src="M9.webp" alt="Mosquito" style="width: 50%;">
            <h3 id="dryer">Hand Dryers Kill The Virus</h3>
            <p>No, hand dryers are not effective at killing the virus. Hand dryers might even be more dangerous than
                beneificial, flying the bacteria and viruses everywhere, including possibly your eyes, nose or mouth.
            </p>
